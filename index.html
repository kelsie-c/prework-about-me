      <p>I enjoy all types of crafting including knitting, sewing, drawing, and other material crafts. I also like to bake, and on nice days go for hikes. On my bucket list for post-COVID is to attend as many summer festivals in Columbus as I can.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>It's pretty simple really. I want to be a full-stack developer working toward leading my own team in the next 5 years. I want to continue learning and expand my skillset to include AI and machine learning.</p>
